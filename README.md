Project Report:

This report contains the details of a project that involved image recognition of various food items. The project utilized TensorFlow with Keras to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying different food categories. The images of the food items were organized into three directories: training, validation, and testing.

In the training directory, there were 700 images for each food category. The validation directory contained 200 images for each category, while the test directory had 100 images for each category. It is important to note that the test images were not used for training or validation purposes. They were only utilized after the training and validation stages to predict the food category in the images.

For those using Google Colab, it was necessary to upload the images to Google Drive. This process might have taken some time due to the size of the zip file, which was approximately 241 MB. Additionally, the images had different sizes, so resizing was required to ensure uniformity before utilizing them in the model.

Once the model was trained, the following evaluation components were provided:

1. Graph showing the loss during training.
2. Classification report.
3. Confusion Matrix.

These components were crucial in assessing the performance and accuracy of the trained model.
